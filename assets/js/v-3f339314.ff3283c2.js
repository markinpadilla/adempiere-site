They need to leverage new technologies and provide additional smarter functionality. Even canned applications should even support additional functionality, although usually not appropriate for integration with the functional core of a growing business.</p><p>Adempiere uses the following design principles to create a sustainable architecture:</p><p>Smalltalk MVC Architecture which is a derivation of the Model-View-Controller approach. Explicit Rules Engine for complex Transaction Logic and transaction safe fail recovery.</p><p>ERP has an object architecture each object is as independent as possible from other objects, including transactional derivation.</p><h2 id="safe-fail" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#safe-fail" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Safe-Fail</h2><p>Usually the applications are designed to be free of faults (fail-safe): It is assumed that everything works and that all data are entered correctly and are consistent. In case of failure, experts must find the cause and check if there was damage. The user usually notices the problem. The reality is that applications sometimes fail.</p><p>In contrast ADempiere is designed to be safe-fail. Each transaction can be repeated and regenerated. Most failures are identified by the system and the user can try to solve the problem. If recovery is not possible, the error is isolated and the rest of the system continues to work. Decoupled design is based transaction is enabled.</p><p>The system checks regularly whether a transaction is complete. If a transaction is not complete and consistent due to a system failure, the administrator and the user is informed.</p><p>As applications become more complex with ever increasing combinations, the errors grow exponentially. ERP provides a framework for extensive validation and in case of failure, isolate the problem by ensuring high availability of the central functions (application kernel).</p><h2 id="security" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#security" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Security</h2><p>ADempiere supports data security and functions. The safety function is based on User Roles and Access Controls Windows, Reports and Processes.</p><p>The data security for customer information and the Organization is maintained at the level of the database through the security context. This is an additional level of security beyond identification (login) regular user of the database. This allows the use of third-party tools based on SQL to access the database. Before accessing any data the user must be identified through a stored procedure (stored procedure) with username, password and optionally language role. This provides the same access rules for third-party tools that may exist in the application.</p><p>Most applications do not have a layer of security beyond the user ID of the database and have difficulty restricting access through third-party SQL tools.</p><p>The Customer Passwords are stored in encrypted form.</p>',24)],n={},s=(0,a(13860).Z)(n,[["render",function(e,t){return(0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("div",null,r)}]])},11278:(e,t,a)=>{a.r(t),a.d(t,{data:()=>i});const i=JSON.parse('{"key":"v-3f339314","path":"/product/technology.html","title":"Technology","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Technology","category":["Product"],"star":9,"sticky":9,"tag":["Software"],"article":false,"summary":"Technology Elements ADempiere is a 100% pure Java solution.; It is based upon Oracle Database technology; It natively supports Postgresql Open Source Database; Features a 100% Java","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://github.com/adempiere/adempiere-site.github.io/product/technology.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"Technology"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2022-07-02T18:08:52.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale:alternate","content":"es-ES"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"Software"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2022-07-02T18:08:52.000Z"}]]},"excerpt":"","headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Technology Elements","slug":"technology-elements","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Application Dictionary","slug":"application-dictionary","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Intelligent User Interface","slug":"intelligent-user-interface","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Intelligent Reports","slug":"intelligent-reports","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Sustainable Architecture","slug":"sustainable-architecture","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Safe-Fail","slug":"safe-fail","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Security","slug":"security","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1656783345000,"updatedTime":1656785332000,"contributors":[{"name":"Yamel Senih","email":"ysenih@erpya.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.87,"words":861},"filePathRelative":"product/technology.md","localizedDate":"July 2, 2022"}')}}]);
