The ADempiere Association arbitrate in any dispute over the conduct of a member of the community.</p><p><strong>Be considerate</strong>. Your work will be used by other people, and you depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, andwe hope you will take into account the consequences when making decisions.</p><p><strong>Be respectful</strong>. The ADempiere community and its members treat each other with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution to the ADempiere project. You may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We can all experience some frustration now and then, but we can not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. It is important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not productive. We expect members of the ADempiere community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people outside the Adempiere Project</p><p><strong>Be collaborative</strong>. The ADempiere project and Free Software are all about collaboration and teamwork. Collaboration reduces redundancy of work done in the Free Software world, and improves the quality of the software produced. You should try to work with other ADempiere implementers, as well as others in the communitymay be interested in the work you do. Your work should be done transparently and patches of Adempiere, when performed, should be given to the community. If you want to work on new code for new projects, at least keep those projects informed of your ideas and progress. It may not be possible to obtain the consensus of the project or even from your colleagues about the correct implementation of an idea, so do not feel obliged to have that agreement before you begin, but at least keep informedthe outside world of your work, and publishyour work in a way that allowsothers to test, discuss and contribute to your efforts.</p><p><strong>When you disagree, check</strong>. Disagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time and the ADempiere community is no exception. The important thing is not to avoid disagreements or differences of opinion but to resolve them constructively. Go to the community and the community process to seek advice and to resolve disagreements.The ADempierecommunity will help you decide the right course for the project. There are also several Project Teams and Team. Leaders, who may be able to help you figure out which direction would be moreacceptable. If you really want to go a different way, then we encourage you to make a derivative distribution or alternative set of packages available using the framework of ADempiere package management, so that the community can try these changes and ideas for themselves and contribute to the discussion.</p><p><strong>When you are unsure, ask for help</strong>. Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in the ADempiere community. Asking questions avoids many problems down the road, so we encourage questions. Theperson you ask would most probable be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, you must be careful to do so in an appropriate forum.</p><p><strong>Leave with consideration</strong>. Developers on every project come and go and the ADempiere project is no different. When youleave the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you&#39;re working with you, you are leaving and take appropriate measures to ensure that others can pick up where you leave.</p><h2 id="shearing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#shearing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Shearing</h2><p>The Code of Conduct ADempiere is based on Ubuntu Code of Conduct.
