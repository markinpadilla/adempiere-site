With the exception of Report Views, the model is usually given. If you provide a SQL Select statement a Report View can be created, the user doesn&#39;t need to resolve foreign key references (which require the knowledge of the data model) or worry about data security, as ADempiere resolves these issues for the user. This allows the writing of &#39;simple&#39; statements. Few people agree on how each report should look. ADempiere allows the user to define the format of any report at the System, Client, Organisation or User level:</strong></p><ul><li>Report columns</li><li>Column order</li><li>Report sorting</li><li>Column heading</li><li>Sums (for numeric columns)</li><li>Grouping</li><li>Pie Chart</li><li>Bar/Line Chart</li></ul><p><strong>Data selection is via Report Parameters when initiating the report, or via Query, allowing the user to enter criteria in an enhanced &#39;query by example&#39; style.</strong></p><h2 id="data-and-meta-data" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#data-and-meta-data" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Data and meta-data</h2><p><strong>Programmers of many applications that do not use the sophistication of an Active Data Dictionary need to design, code and test every screen. ADempiere uses the more advanced concept of a central active data dictionary, also called information repository. ADempiere&#39;s active data dictionary is at the meta-data layer, and knows how to access data and how data is related.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>The data dictionary contains:</strong></p><ul><li>Definitions of a data entity (type, validation, etc.)</li><li>Method of display (label on screens and reports, help, display sequence and position relative to other fields)</li><li>Display rules</li><li>Security and access rules</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>The data dictionary is &#39;active&#39;, meaning it is used at runtime and is context sensitive. For example: it &#39;knows&#39; that an over-the-counter sale does not have a payment term and does not display it. However if you change the transaction type to a standard order, a payment term becomes a mandatory part of the transaction.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The Active Data Dictionary is user-extensible and can include user specified rules and information. The extensibility of the Active Data Dictionary simplifies user extensions to the application since much of what would otherwise have to be coded by programmers can be created by a knowledgeable and authorised users (with System privilege) from within the application</strong></p></li></ul><h2 id="supportability" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#supportability" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Supportability</h2><p><strong>Software Support represents a substantial portion of the lifetime costs of any complex system. A flexible, modular architecture is essential for ensuring:</strong></p><ul><li>Understandability</li><li>Modifiability</li><li>Interoperability</li><li>Reusability</li><li>Expandability</li><li>Portability</li></ul><p>all of which are necessary for software that can be supported in an efficient and cost effective manner. Many problems associated with software support can be traced to deficiencies in the way the original software product was designed. Lack of attention to the design of modular software architectures during development can cause excessive software support problems and costs. ADempiere is designed to be as flexible as possible and to accommodate change. Unless the system architecture allows for change, modifications to the software are likely to be difficult and defect-prone. ADempiere&#39;s software architecture carefully addresses abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding to minimize dependencies. By maximising use of object-oriented design, the software can be easily modified. ADempiere&#39;s Active Data Dictionary ensures that software support can be simplified by ensuring that changes are made in one location with a consistent impact throughout the whole of the application. Additionally, ADempiere uses no third-party toolsets which may become unsupported due to lack of interest by their respective vendors. Other than for the Oracle database itself, source code for all aspects of the system is open and available ensuring that the user community will always be able to provide support for all aspects of the system.</p>',35)],s={},o=(0,i(13860).Z)(s,[["render",function(e,t){return(0,a.wg)(),(0,a.iD)("div",null,r)}]])},79445:(e,t,i)=>{i.r(t),i.d(t,{data:()=>a});const a=JSON.parse('{"key":"v-ca5689ce","path":"/product/","title":"ADempiere Features","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"ADempiere Features","category":["Product"],"star":9,"sticky":9,"tag":["Sales","Purchase","Inventory","Accounting"],"article":false,"summary":"Business Processes Product Cost; Product Manufacture; Product Account; Sales Processes.
